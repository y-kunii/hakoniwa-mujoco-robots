### TurtleBot3 + 2D LiDAR Demo Notes

This demo shows a TurtleBot3 Burger running on MuJoCo with a 2D LiDAR simulation connected through Hakoniwa PDU.

The point is not only to visualize LiDAR point clouds, but also to reproduce differences in sensor noise characteristics.

- With TurtleBot3's standard `LDS-01`, the point cloud is visibly noisier
- With the `URG-04LX-UG01`-like profile, obstacle contours appear much clearer

One important Sim2Real theme in Hakoniwa is to represent the practical difference users experience when changing sensors, not just robot motion alone.

Configuration:
- ROS-derived TurtleBot3 model executed on MuJoCo
- 2D LiDAR simulated by raycast using the selected sensor profile
- Scan frequency, angular range, angular resolution, and noise model are loaded from JSON
- Output published as `LaserScan` PDU on Hakoniwa
- Point cloud visualized by a Python visualizer
- Noise differences reproduced for `LDS-01` and `URG-04LX-UG01`-equivalent settings

### Forklift RD-light Handoff Demo

This is an advanced experimental demo.  
It runs two MuJoCo forklift assets and performs single-node ownership handoff with context save/restore.

- RD-light is an **advanced / experimental** handoff demo
- It is not RD-full
- See [docs/guide/forklift-context-rd.md](docs/guide/forklift-context-rd.md) and [rd-design.md](rd-design.md) for details

## Architecture

Hakoniwa PDU is the hub, and MuJoCo (C++) communicates with Python controllers / visualizers over that contract.

- **Hakoniwa**: synchronization and PDU runtime
- **MuJoCo C++ Asset**: physics stepping + PDU read/write
- **Python Controller / Visualizer**: input and inspection tools
- **PDU JSON**: contract of channels/types/sizes

```text
+-----------------------------+      PDU (shared contract)      +----------------------+

## Quick Start: TurtleBot3 + 2D LiDAR

This is the shortest path to verify **MuJoCo + Hakoniwa + TurtleBot3 + gamepad + LiDAR**.

Demo choices:

- Interactive: `tb3-demo.bash` or the manual `tb3_sim` + `tb3_gamepad.py` flow.
  Use this when a gamepad is available.
- Automated: `tb3-mbody-demo.bash`. Use this for scripted route demos, CI-like
  checks, or AI-agent execution where no joystick is available.
- Multi-process mirror: `tb3-dual-mirror-demo.bash`. Use this to run two
  independently simulated TurtleBot3 processes where each process owns one real
  robot and mirrors the other robot through pose PDU.
- MBody-generated models: `tb3-mbody-demo.bash` with `HAKO_TB3_MODEL=burger`,
  `waffle`, or `waffle_pi`.

Prepare 4 terminals.

1. simulator
```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim
```

2. gamepad controller
```bash
python python/tb3_gamepad.py
```

For a joystick-free scripted route demo, use:

```bash
python python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern square
```

To run the same TB3 runtime against the minimal world generated by
`hakoniwa-mbody-registry`, use the launcher-based MBody demo:

```bash
bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
```

This uses `hakoniwa-pdu`'s launcher to start the simulator, issue
`hako-cmd start`, and run a joystick-free scripted route demo. It defaults to
Burger with the MuJoCo viewer, LiDAR plot, trajectory trail, and a `figure8`
route.

Useful variants:

```bash
HAKO_TB3_MODEL=waffle HAKO_TB3_ROUTE_PATTERN=figure8 bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
HAKO_TB3_MODEL=waffle_pi HAKO_TB3_ROUTE_PATTERN=figure8 bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=0 HAKO_TB3_ROUTE_PATTERN=showcase bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
HAKO_TB3_ROUTE_PATTERN=dance HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=1 bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
HAKO_TB3_HOLD_SEC=15 bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
ACTIVATE_MODE=activate-only bash tb3-mbody-demo.bash
```

For a multi-process mirror demo, use:

```bash
bash tb3-dual-mirror-demo.bash
```

This launcher starts four processes:

- Process A: real Burger + mirrored Waffle, Conductor owner, Viewer enabled.
- Process B: real Waffle + mirrored Burger, Conductor disabled, Viewer disabled.
- Controller A: drives `TB3_BURGER/hako_cmd_game`.
- Controller B: drives `TB3_WAFFLE/hako_cmd_game`.
- LiDAR visualizers: show `TB3_BURGER/laser_scan` and `TB3_WAFFLE/laser_scan`.

Process A's viewer is the intended observation point. It shows the local real
Burger and the remote Waffle mirrored from `TB3_WAFFLE/base_link_pos`. Process B
still runs real Waffle physics and publishes `TB3_WAFFLE/base_link_pos`, but it
does not open a viewer. Two LiDAR plot windows are opened side by side, one for
each real robot's `laser_scan` PDU. Only one simulator process should own
Conductor startup.

Use the manual commands below when debugging each process separately.

```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim_burger
```

`tb3_sim_burger` defaults to `config/assets/tb3-mbody-burger-asset.json`,
runs without the viewer, omits the camera component, and maps the generated
wheel `<velocity>` actuators through `config/actuator/joint/tb3_mbody_*.json`.
Set `HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=1` to show the viewer.

For a visual Burger demo, run:

```bash
HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=1 ./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim_burger
/usr/local/hakoniwa/bin/hako-cmd start
python3.12 python/tb3_lidar_visualizer.py
python3.12 python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern figure8 --forward-sec 5.0 --linear-axis 0.6 --yaw-axis 0.85 --hold-sec 6
```

For the MBody-generated TurtleBot3 Waffle runtime demo, use:

```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim_waffle
/usr/local/hakoniwa/bin/hako-cmd start
python3.12 python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern figure8 --linear-axis 0.6 --yaw-axis 0.7
```

`tb3_sim_waffle` defaults to `config/assets/tb3-mbody-waffle-asset.json`,
runs without the viewer, and uses a Waffle wheel separation default of `0.288`.
Set `HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=1` to show the viewer.

For the MBody-generated TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi runtime demo, use:

```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim_waffle_pi
/usr/local/hakoniwa/bin/hako-cmd start
python3.12 python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern figure8 --linear-axis 0.6 --yaw-axis 0.7
```

`tb3_sim_waffle_pi` defaults to
`config/assets/tb3-mbody-waffle-pi-asset.json`, runs without the viewer, and
uses a Waffle-compatible wheel separation default of `0.288`.
Set `HAKO_TB3_ENABLE_VIEWER=1` to show the viewer.

3. LiDAR visualizer
```bash
python python/lidar_visualizer.py
```

4. start trigger
```bash
hako-cmd start
```

To switch LiDAR spec:
```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/lds-01.json
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/lds-02.json
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/urg-04lx-ug01.json
```

## Quick Start: Forklift

This is the shortest path for the forklift unit sample.

Prepare 3 terminals.

1. simulator
```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/forklift/forklift_unit_sim
```

2. Python controller
```bash
python -m python.forklift_simple_auto config/forklift-unit-compact.json \
  --forward-distance 2.0 --backward-distance 2.0 --move-speed 0.7
```

3. start trigger
```bash
hako-cmd start
```

For compatibility, `controll.bash` is temporarily kept and internally calls `control.bash`.

## Prerequisites

### 1) Install hakoniwa-core-pro (required)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hakoniwalab/hakoniwa-core-pro.git
cd hakoniwa-core-pro
bash build.bash
bash install.bash
```

Set paths if needed:

Linux:
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/hakoniwa/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/hakoniwa/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

macOS:
```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/hakoniwa/bin:$PATH
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/hakoniwa/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### 2) Install hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint (required)

This repository links against the installed C++ `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hakoniwalab/hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint.git
cd hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint
bash build.bash
sudo bash install.bash
```

If you install it outside `/usr/local/hakoniwa`, set:

```bash
export HAKONIWA_PDU_ENDPOINT_ROOT=/path/to/hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint/install
```

If Hakoniwa core is also outside `/usr/local/hakoniwa`, set:

```bash
export HAKONIWA_CORE_ROOT=/path/to/hakoniwa-core-pro/install
```

### 3) Install Python runtime packages (required for Python tools)

Python controllers and visualizers under `python/` are intended to run with
Python 3.12. They use two Python-side Hakoniwa pieces:

- `hakopy`: Hakoniwa core Python binding installed by `hakoniwa-core-pro`.
- `hakoniwa-pdu`: PDU message types, serializers, and `PduManager` installed
  with `pip`.

Install `hakoniwa-core-pro` first, following its README. The core install step
installs the `hakopy` Python binding. Newer installer flows may also write a
Hakoniwa environment file; source it when it exists:

```bash
test -f /usr/local/hakoniwa/env.bash && source /usr/local/hakoniwa/env.bash
```

If that file does not exist, set the equivalent environment variables manually
when needed:

```bash
export HAKONIWA_HOME=/usr/local/hakoniwa
export PATH="${HAKONIWA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="${HAKONIWA_HOME}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:-}"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="${HAKONIWA_HOME}/lib/pkgconfig:${PKG_CONFIG_PATH:-}"
```

Then use the same Python 3.12 executable for checks, installs, and scripts:

```bash
python3.12 -c "import hakopy; print(hakopy)"
python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade "hakoniwa-pdu>=1.6.1"
```

If Python 3.12 is managed by a version manager such as pyenv, use the same
resolved executable consistently:

```bash
PYTHON_CMD="$(command -v python3.12)" ./doctor.bash
"$(command -v python3.12)" python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern square
```

Check the installed version:

```bash
python3.12 -m pip show hakoniwa-pdu
```

This is required for commands such as:

```bash
python3.12 python/tb3_gamepad.py
python3.12 python/tb3_route_demo.py --pattern square
python3.12 -m python.forklift_simple_auto config/forklift-unit-compact.json
python3.12 python/lidar_visualizer.py
```

### 4) OS notes

- macOS: `brew install glfw`
- Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgl1 libgl1-mesa-dri libglx-mesa0 mesa-utils libglfw3-dev
```

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hakoniwalab/hakoniwa-mujoco-robots.git
cd hakoniwa-mujoco-robots
git submodule update --init --recursive
./doctor.bash
./build.bash
```

- MuJoCo version is managed by `MUJOCO_VERSION.txt`.
- `./build.bash` runs a preflight check before CMake and reports missing prerequisites such as `hakoniwa-core-pro`, `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint`, or `glfw3`.
- If the preflight check blocks a custom setup temporarily, use `HAKO_SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1 ./build.bash`.
- Clean build:
```bash
./build.bash clean
```

## Environment Diagnostics

Run this before `./build.bash` when setting up a new machine:

```bash
./doctor.bash
```

The doctor command checks local prerequisites without building:

- CMake and Git
- `hakoniwa-core-pro` package config
- `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` package config
- `hakoniwa-pdu >= 1.6.1` for Python tools
- `glfw3`
- `MUJOCO_VERSION.txt`

Fix reported failures first, then run `./build.bash`.

### Windows (MSVC + PowerShell)

The Windows build is intended to run after `hakoniwa-core-pro` and `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` have already been built and installed on Windows.

Prerequisites:
- `hakoniwa-core-pro` is installed under a prefix such as `C:\project\hakoniwa-core-pro\install`
- `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` is installed under a prefix such as `C:\project\hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint\install`
- `vcpkg` packages for Windows are available under `C:\project\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows`
- Run the build from Windows PowerShell when possible

PowerShell:

```powershell
.\build-win.ps1 -Clean `
  -HakoniwaCoreRoot C:\project\hakoniwa-core-pro\install `
  -HakoniwaPduEndpointRoot C:\project\hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint\install `
  -ExtraPrefixPaths C:\project\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows
```

WSL / Git Bash wrapper:

```bash
./build-win.bash
```

Notes:
- `build-win.ps1` runs a preflight check before CMake and reports missing install roots, missing package config files, and missing `glfw3` / `vcpkg` prefix information.
- The script configures with `-S src`, matching the existing Unix build layout.
- `HakoniwaCoreRoot` is forwarded to `HAKONIWA_INSTALL_PREFIX`.
- `HakoniwaPduEndpointRoot` is forwarded to `HAKONIWA_PDU_ENDPOINT_PREFIX`.
- `ExtraPrefixPaths` is used to resolve Windows packages such as `glfw3` and transitive dependencies required by `hakoniwa_pdu_endpoint`.
- `HakoniwaPduEndpointRoot` must point to an installed prefix created by `cmake --install`, not a build directory such as `build-win` or `build-shared`. The `hakoniwa_pdu_endpointConfig.cmake` generated in the build tree is not directly consumable by this project.
- If you build `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` yourself, install it first:

```powershell
cmake --install C:\project\hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint\build-win --config Release --prefix C:\project\hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint\install
```

- Successful outputs are generated under `build-win/Release/mujoco-common.lib`.
- Successful outputs are generated under `build-win/sensors/Release/msensors.lib`.
- Successful outputs are generated under `build-win/main_for_sample/forklift/Release/forklift_sim.exe`.
- Successful outputs are generated under `build-win/main_for_sample/forklift/Release/forklift_unit_sim.exe`.
- Successful outputs are generated under `build-win/main_for_sample/tb3/Release/tb3_sim.exe`.
- On Windows, runtime DLLs such as `hakoniwa_pdu_endpoint.dll` are copied next to each `.exe` after build.
- If Windows reports `forklift_simulation_loop.obj: Permission denied`, that is a file lock issue, not a source code issue. Close `MSBuild.exe`, `cl.exe`, or `devenv.exe` and rebuild.
- The Python endpoint binding is built separately from the C++ samples. For `python/tb3_gamepad.py`, build the vendored `thirdparty/hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint` Python runtime with Hakoniwa core support enabled:

```powershell
cd .\thirdparty\hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint
.\build-python-win.ps1 `
  -Clean `
  -BuildNative `
  -BuildFfi `
  -EnableHakoniwaCore `
  -HakoniwaCoreRoot C:\project\hakoniwa-core-pro\install `
  -BuildDirName build-win `
  -Configuration Release `
  -PythonCommand python `
  -ToolchainFile C:\project\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake `
  -VcpkgTriplet x64-windows `
  -Platform x64
```

- `python/tb3_gamepad.py` prefers the vendored Python package under `thirdparty/hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint/python`, so it will use the locally built runtime instead of a stale site-packages installation when both are present.

## Detailed Run Commands

### C++ samples

- Forklift:
```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/forklift/forklift_sim
```

- Forklift unit (no cargo, useful for auto-control tests):

python3 examples/sensors/livox_mid360s/livox-mid360s-hakoniwa-asset.py   # publisher, owns Conductor
python3 examples/sensors/livox_mid360s/read_point_cloud.py               # reader, Open3D window
hako-cmd start                                                           # once both report WAITING
```

- Joint actuator example (`a/d` changes position target, `j/l` changes velocity target in the MuJoCo viewer):
```bash
./src/cmake-build/examples/actuators/joint/joint-actuator-example
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for the current example index.

## TurtleBot3 2D LiDAR

The TurtleBot3 Burger sample includes a MuJoCo-based 2D LiDAR implementation.

Note:
- `models/tb3/turtlebot3_burger_world.xml` currently uses primitive geoms for the body, wheels, and LiDAR housing instead of external mesh files.
- This avoids runtime failures caused by machine-specific absolute mesh paths when running on Windows.
- The wheel actuators are MuJoCo `<velocity>` actuators. Gamepad input is converted to left / right wheel angular velocity targets before being written through `JointActuatorImpl`.
- Linear velocity and yaw-rate targets are rate-limited before conversion to wheel angular velocities. Defaults include `HAKO_TB3_MAX_YAW_RATE=1.2`, `HAKO_TB3_MAX_LINEAR_ACCELERATION=0.1`, `HAKO_TB3_MAX_YAW_ACCELERATION=0.5`, and `HAKO_TB3_COMMAND_DEADZONE=0.1`.
- The rear caster uses low friction so it does not dominate the drive-wheel behavior.

- 360-degree raycast
- scan-frame generation based on the selected sensor profile
  - e.g. 10 Hz / 100 ms for `urg-04lx-ug01.json`
  - e.g. 5 Hz / 200 ms for `lds-01.json` and `lds-02.json`
- `LaserScan`-compatible PDU published on Hakoniwa
- Point cloud inspection via Python visualizer

To avoid MuJoCo ray self / near-body interference around the LiDAR mount, the implementation detects self-geometry hits and retries raycasting just beyond the hit point. This avoids relying on a large fixed origin offset and keeps close obstacle perception more natural.

## Sensor Noise Profiles

LiDAR behavior can be switched by sensor config JSON.

- `config/sensors/lidar/lds-01.json`
  - noisy profile close to TurtleBot3 standard `LDS-01`
  - range: 0.12-3.5 m
  - scan: 5 Hz, 1.0 deg resolution
  - spec: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds_01/

- `config/sensors/lidar/lds-02.json`
  - longer-range profile close to TurtleBot3 `LDS-02`
  - range: 0.16-8.0 m
  - scan: 5 Hz, 1.0 deg resolution

  - cleaner profile based on Hokuyo `URG-04LX-UG01`
  - range: 0.02-5.56 m
  - scan: 10 Hz, 0.3515625 deg resolution
  - useful for comparing clearer obstacle contours against LDS-style profiles

Switch example:
```bash
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/lds-01.json
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/lds-02.json
./src/cmake-build/main_for_sample/tb3/tb3_sim config/sensors/lidar/urg-04lx-ug01.json
```

This is intended to capture a practical Sim2Real point: changing sensors changes perception quality.

## Camera Depth Status

Camera / depth / RGBD sensor components are available under `include/sensors/camera/` and `src/sensors/camera/`.

- Depth conversion currently assumes the MuJoCo offscreen path where `mjr_readPixels` returns an OpenGL-style depth buffer.
- Camera rendering temporarily applies each sensor JSON `clip.near/far` to MuJoCo's effective clip planes before reading RGB/depth pixels.
- Camera / depth / RGBD / multicamera profiles under `config/sensors/camera/*.json` can be loaded into C++ configs.
- The profile structure is documented in `config/sensors/schema/`, and the JSON loader reuses the existing `LoadConfig(config)` validation path.
- Camera unit tests live under `tests/sensors/camera/unit/` and cover config loader, PDU converter, and local depth encoding.
- These unit tests do not require an OpenGL render context and are intended to run in CI.
- This path has been smoke-tested with fixed-camera box scenes at `0.2`, `0.5`, `1.0`, `2.0`, `5.0`, and `9.0` meters.
- The smoke test also checks several image positions, multiple horizontal FOV settings, and clip-range NaN masking.
- Render smoke tests live under `tests/sensors/camera/smoke/` and require MuJoCo + OpenGL, so they are intended for local/manual runs or dedicated CI.
- It is still not claimed to be fully validated for arbitrary scenes such as oblique geometry, extreme camera setups, or alternative depth-map conventions.

## Sensor Components And Examples

Reusable sensor components live under `src/sensors/`, with JSON profiles under `config/sensors/` and schemas under `config/sensors/schema/`.
PDU converters and adapters live under `include/hakoniwa/pdu/`.

Design and schema references:
- [Sensor/Actuator User Guide](docs/guide/sensor-actuator-user.md)
- [JSON Config Guide](docs/guide/json-config.md)
- [MJCF / JSON Authoring Guide](docs/guide/mjcf-json-authoring.md)
- [Sensor/Actuator PDU Design](docs/spec/sensor-actuator-design.md)
- [Sensor/Actuator Config Schemas](docs/spec/sensor-actuator-config-schema.md)

Current sensor areas:
- camera / depth / RGBD / multicamera
- color camera PNG example
- 2D LiDAR
- 3D LiDAR (Livox Mid-360S, C++ and Python, `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`)
- ultrasonic range
- IMU
- joint state
- odometry
- TF
- noise helpers
- debug ray visualization

The standalone examples are intentionally smaller than the TurtleBot3 and forklift demos. They are useful for checking one feature at a time:
- [examples/README.md](examples/README.md)
- [examples/sensors/README.md](examples/sensors/README.md)
- [examples/sensors/ultrasonic/README.md](examples/sensors/ultrasonic/README.md)
- [examples/sensors/color_camera/README.md](examples/sensors/color_camera/README.md)
- [examples/sensors/livox_mid360s/README.md](examples/sensors/livox_mid360s/README.md)
- [examples/actuators/README.md](examples/actuators/README.md)
- [examples/actuators/joint/README.md](examples/actuators/joint/README.md)

Sensor unit tests are optional build targets:
```bash
cmake -S src -B src/cmake-build -DHAKO_BUILD_SENSOR_TESTS=ON
cmake --build src/cmake-build --target run_sensor_unit_tests
```

Camera render smoke tests require a MuJoCo / OpenGL runtime:
```bash
cmake -S src -B src/cmake-build -DHAKO_BUILD_CAMERA_SMOKE_TESTS=ON
cmake --build src/cmake-build --target camera_smoke_tests
```

## FAQ

### Q1. What should I run first?

Run the environment doctor first:

```bash
./doctor.bash
```

Fix any `FAIL` lines, then run:

```bash
./build.bash
```

### Q2. Python tools fail even after installing `hakoniwa-pdu`. Why?

`hakoniwa-pdu` does not provide `hakopy`. `hakopy` is the Python binding built
and installed by `hakoniwa-core-pro`, and this repository expects Python 3.12
for Python-side Hakoniwa tools.

The most common cause is a Python environment mismatch. These must all refer to
the same Python 3.12 environment:

- the Python used when `hakoniwa-core-pro` installed `hakopy`
- the Python used to run `python3.12 -m pip install hakoniwa-pdu`
- the Python used to run scripts such as `python/tb3_route_demo.py`

First install `hakoniwa-core-pro` following its README, then check that
`hakopy` is visible to Python 3.12:

```bash
test -f /usr/local/hakoniwa/env.bash && source /usr/local/hakoniwa/env.bash
python3.12 -c "import hakopy; print(hakopy)"
```

Then install `hakoniwa-pdu` into that same Python:

```bash
python3.12 -m pip show hakoniwa-pdu
python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade "hakoniwa-pdu>=1.6.1"
```

If `import hakopy` fails, reinstall or rebuild `hakoniwa-core-pro` with Python
3.12 available, then re-run the install step. `./doctor.bash` prints the Python
executable it checks.

If you want to check a specific Python environment, pass `PYTHON_CMD`:

```bash
PYTHON_CMD=/path/to/python3.12 ./doctor.bash
/path/to/python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade "hakoniwa-pdu>=1.6.1"
```

### Q3. CMake cannot find `hakoniwa-core-pro` or `hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint`.

Install both packages first, then re-run `./doctor.bash`.

If they are not installed under `/usr/local/hakoniwa`, set:

```bash
export HAKONIWA_CORE_ROOT=/path/to/hakoniwa-core-pro/install
export HAKONIWA_PDU_ENDPOINT_ROOT=/path/to/hakoniwa-pdu-endpoint/install
```

### Q4. CMake cannot find `glfw3`.

Install GLFW:

```bash
brew install glfw
```

Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y libglfw3-dev
```

### Q5. Where does the color-camera example write PNG files?

By default, it writes `./camera_color_sample.png` relative to the directory where you run the command. You can pass an explicit output path as the third argument.

### Q6. Do I need the MuJoCo viewer for every example?

No. The main robot demos use the viewer by default, and the standalone sensor / actuator examples are designed for interactive viewer use. Some tests and config checks do not need a viewer.

For Docker on macOS, use headless mode:

```bash
HAKO_DOCKER_GUI=off bash docker/run.bash
```

## Advanced Topics

Advanced forklift context save/restore and RD-light notes are split out of the top-level README.

- [Forklift Context Save/Restore And RD-light](docs/guide/forklift-context-rd.md)
- [RD design notes](rd-design.md)
- [Sensor/Actuator PDU Design](docs/spec/sensor-actuator-design.md)
- [Sensor/Actuator Config Schemas](docs/spec/sensor-actuator-config-schema.md)

The top-level README keeps only the entry points, setup, and sample commands. Use the advanced documents when you need restore evidence, RD-light handoff details, or continuity evaluation workflow.

## Separate native build directory

`python tools/hako.py build --build-dir /path/to/environment/mujoco-build`
selects an external build directory on POSIX and Windows. The CLI option overrides
`build.dir` in the manifest. Relative CLI paths use the current directory; `~` and
symlinks are resolved. Without this option, the existing manifest/native defaults
remain in effect. POSIX builds use `HAKONIWA_CORE_ROOT`, then `HAKONIWA_HOME`, then
`/usr/local/hakoniwa` for the Core prefix.

Concrete Ackermann vehicle applications, Recipes, and PS5 frontends are owned
by `hakoniwa-urban-mobility`. This repository provides the shared MuJoCo
physics, Viewer, mirror-body, and contact/impulse backend used by those
applications.
